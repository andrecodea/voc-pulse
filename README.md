**VoC Pulse** is an AI-driven analytics proof-of-concept (POC) designed to analyze unstructured customer feedback quickly and effectively. Originally developed during a 48-hour sprint, the project provides capabilities to:

- Process customer feedback to extract insights on **Sentiment** (e.g., Positive, Negative, Mixed).
- Identify **Topics** (e.g., "Buffet", "Service").
- Apply **Vector Embeddings** (semantic search) for deeper analysis.

This POC leverages key tools and libraries for rapid data visualization and analysis, presenting insights interactively.

## 🌟 Current Features (Proof of Concept - V1)

- **Interactive Dashboards:** Visualization of customer sentiment trends using **Plotly** for interactive trend charts and **Matplotlib** for distributions.
- **Semantic Pie Charts:** Charts summarizing customer sentiment breakdowns by selectable criteria.
- **Keyword Generators:** Generate dynamic word clouds reflecting common keywords in feedback (e.g., "excellent", "delay").
- **Prototype Retrieval-Augmented Pipeline:** A manually implemented RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system combining **OpenAI API** and **ChromaDB** for querying relevant feedback data.

## 🏃 Current State

This POC is in its early stages, and functionalities such as a complete API backend and agentic capabilities are yet to be developed. The current version is functional as a local app for demonstration of core concepts. Future updates will include:

- Robust API endpoints (using FastAPI).
- Autonomous agents for orchestrating insights generation.
- A full-fledged dashboard for interactive stakeholder discussions.

For a demo or further development, refer to the roadmap in development notes.
